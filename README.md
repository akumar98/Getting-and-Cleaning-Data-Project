## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project

 This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.
The dataset is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset. The dataset is for 30 volunteers who have been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The output of the 5th step is called tidy_data.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
